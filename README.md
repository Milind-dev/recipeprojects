# what i am doing in this project
### feature

I work on both the front end and the back end here. Authentication registration and login require a frontend for React, a backend for Node.js, and a database.
The first page is the dashboard, and there are two links visible: one for registering and another for logging in. if you haven't already registered. Register by going to the registration link.
After submitting the password, it is encrypted and saved in the database on the registration page. When a user clicks on the login page, the user data processing backend side matches the user email and password, as well as the encrypted password, and then it travels to the main page "/Localfiles".

The user searches for specific terms such as pizza and yogurt. That key is kept in a third-party API and .env contains the API key which is  .gitignore.

When a certain query is searched, the query data is displayed on the screen. Now, the user adds data to the cart. cart are user query specific item
